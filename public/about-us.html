                <p>My name is Ikechi Nnawuba (pronounced E-KETCH-E N-NAW-WU-BAH). Most people call me 'Ike' for short. I was born in Washington, DC and had  
                   lived in Maryland for most of my life before moving to San Diego. I graduated from Towson University in Towson, MD with a degree in Computer Information Systems. </p>

                 <p>I am Nigerian and the first of my family to be born outside of Nigeria. My home back in Maryland is a good mix of Nigerian and American culture. Unfortunately I cannot fully speak the language of my tribe, Ibo. I can say a few words like "Hello" and "How are you?" but I would like to be able to speak the entire language someday. I like to bake and cook when I have time and have been told that my southern baked macaroni and cheese is pretty good. Some of my interests/hobbies include: video games, technology, anime, manga, comics, weight lifting, traveling, cooking, and baking.</p>
